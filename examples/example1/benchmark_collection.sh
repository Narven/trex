# Compare collection and full run: with trex (Rust) vs default pytest.
# Do not use set -e so both runs always execute even if one fails.
#
# Why "with trex" can be slower for small suites:
# - Pytest always runs its full collection first (discover files, import modules, build Items).
# - Only then does pytest_collection_modifyitems run and call the trex subprocess.
# - So we pay: Python collection + subprocess spawn + trex + filter. Rust never replaces
#   Python's work; it runs in addition. For 59 tests in one file, subprocess overhead
#   dominates. Trex would only win on very large suites (e.g. 1000+ files) or if we
#   hooked pytest_ignore_collect so Python skips files not in trex's manifest.
