## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Initial release.
- `trex collect <root_dir>` subcommand: recursive file discovery with `--pattern` (default `test_*.py`), regex-based extraction of `test_*` functions and `Test*` class methods, JSON manifest on stdout.
- Pytest plugin (conftest): `pytest_configure` runs trex once and caches manifest + allowed files/dirs; `pytest_ignore_collect` restricts collection to trex-listed paths; `pytest_collection_modifyitems` filters and reorders items using cached manifest. Fallback to default pytest behavior when trex binary is missing or fails.
